Building on the initial setup, we now explore how to ensure your app runs reliably over time, especially in a production environment. We'll cover how to configure systemd units properly, handle logging, and set up automatic restarts in case of failure.\n\nBy using systemd, you gain powerful tools to manage your Node.js application as a background service, allowing it to start at boot, restart on crash, and integrate cleanly with your server's init system. This guide is ideal for developers ready to move beyond local development and into robust server deployments.",

Many were understandably confused—why was another major version arriving so soon, and what would it mean for their existing codebases? The truth, however, is far less dramatic than it first appears. Angular 3 was never meant to be a major architectural shift, and in fact, the versioning oddity arose due to internal package misalignment within Angular’s modules.\n\nRather than representing a significant leap, Angular 3 was skipped in favour of aligning all core packages under the same version number—hence the jump directly to Angular 4. This was a pragmatic decision by the Angular team to prevent confusion down the line. So, developers can breathe easy. If you’re already working with Angular 2, future updates will come with improvements and refinements, not upheaval. It’s a reminder to focus less on version numbers and more on building robust, maintainable applications.',

Express.js and Node.js gave JavaScript newfound back-end functionality—allowing developers to build software with JavaScript on the server side for the first time. Together, they make it possible to build an entire site with JavaScript: You can develop server-side applications with Node.js and then publish those Node.js apps as websites with Express. Because Node.js itself wasn’t intended to build websites, the Express framework is able to layer in built-in structure and functions needed to actually build a site. It’s a pretty lightweight framework that’s great for giving developers extra, built-in web application features and the Express API without overriding the already robust, feature-packed Node.js platform. In short, Express and Node are changing the way developers build websites.',

      'An Introduction to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) in JavaScript and .NET',
    topic: 'coding',
    author: 'cooljmessy',
    body: 'When designing an application that will communicate with a remote computer, a data format and exchange protocol must be selected. There are a variety of open, standardized options, and the ideal choice depends on the applications requirements and pre-existing functionality. For example, SOAP-based web services format the data in an XML payload wrapped within a SOAP envelope. While XML works well for many application scenarios, it has some drawbacks that make it less than ideal for others. One such space where XML is often less than ideal is with Ajax-style web applications. Ajax is a technique used for building interactive web applications that provide a snappier user experience through the use of out-of-band, lightweight calls to the web server in lieu of full-page postbacks. These asynchronous calls are initiated on the client using JavaScript and involve formatting data, sending it to a web server, and parsing and working with the returned data. While most browsers can construct, send, and parse XML, JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) provides a standardized data exchange format that is better-suited for Ajax-style web applications. JSON is an open, text-based data exchange format (see RFC 4627). Like XML, it is human-readable, platform independent, and enjoys a wide availability of implementations. Data formatted according to the JSON standard is lightweight and can be parsed by JavaScript implementations with incredible ease, making it an ideal data exchange format for Ajax web applications. Since it is primarily a data format, JSON is not limited to just Ajax web applications, and can be used in virtually any scenario where applications need to exchange or store structured information as text. This article examines the JSON standard, its relationship to JavaScript, and how it compares to XML. Jayrock, an open-source JSON implementation for .NET, is discussed and examples of creating and parsing JSON messages are provided in JavaScript and C#.',

    body: 'As your JavaScript projects grow in complexity, the importance of designing clear, consistent, and adaptable APIs becomes increasingly apparent. What begins as a simple function or utility can quickly evolve into a library used by others, each with their own expectations and varying levels of expertise. A poorly designed API not only frustrates developers, it can also hinder the scalability and maintainability of your codebase.\n\nTo design a better JavaScript API, clarity should be your guiding principle. Choose intuitive function names, establish predictable input and output patterns, and provide thoughtful documentation. Consider the developer experience at every step—error messages should be informative, default behaviours sensible, and flexibility should never come at the cost of simplicity. Ultimately, a good API doesn’t just expose functionality; it communicates intent and empowers others to build confidently on your work.',

While Thiem initially took control by winning the first set, Djokovic’s resilience saw him stage a comeback and eventually secure the victory. Mourinho, ever the keen observer of performance under pressure, appeared captivated by the contest.\n\nBut beyond his love of sport, another intriguing question has surfaced: what does Mourinho’s handwriting reveal about the man himself? Handwriting analysis, or graphology, suggests that tightly looped letters and firm strokes might reflect his meticulous nature and intense focus. Meanwhile, any sharp angles or rigid spacing could indicate a strategic thinker who values control and order. In Mourinho’s case, his handwriting may offer a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of one of football’s most complex figures.',

I was an advocate of Big Sam’s appointment because of the fact he managed down the league and could see that talent lay beyond just the big clubs in the country. Roy had many faults but the biggest frustration for me was he failed to utilise an already diminished pool of English players by continuing to pick the so called elite players – who are all tainted with failure. To be fair to Allardyce his first England game came so early in the season that it made making whole sale changes difficult. We shall never know if he would have picked different players.

    body: "The history of Futbol Club Barcelona goes from the football club's founding in 1899 and up to current time. FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their first of many European competitions, and has since amassed ten UEFA trophies and a sextuple. In 1928, Barcelona co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a string of other clubs. As of 2016, Barcelona has never been relegated from La Liga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao and arch-rival Real Madrid. The history of Barcelona has often been politically. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.",

Well, for pretty much the same reason that we undertake any analytics study. If we can develop an objective scale which measures the intensity of a press then coaches can quickly see at a glance the strength, or otherwise, of the high pressing that their opposition has utilised in recent games. Teams or fans can also assess how much pressure their team exerted on the opposition in deep positions, and who knows, perhaps in time we will be able to assess the effectiveness that individual players have on the ability of their team to press. In essence we can take what is otherwise a subjective description and reduce it to one number so that it allows for comparison, analysis and ranking, if so desired.',

    topic: 'football',
    author: 'jessjelly',
    body: 'At lunchtime on the day of the Champions League final in 2012, Chelsea’s manager Roberto Di Matteo had selected 10 of his 11 players. He just didn’t know who to play in left midfield. The player would have to combat Bayern Munich’s brilliant Arjen Robben and Philipp Lahm. Going into the last team meeting, Di Matteo had a private chat with his left-back, Ashley Cole. He outlined the situation, then asked Cole who he would play at left-midfield. Instead of naming a seasoned star, Cole said: “Ryan Bertrand.” The 22-year-old reserve Bertrand had never played in the Champions League, let alone in club football’s biggest game. “Why?” asked Di Matteo, surprised. “I trust him,” replied Cole. Bertrand played well, and Chelsea beat Bayern on penalties. In part, this was a victory for talent management. Di Matteo had put aside his ego, and let trust between two players drive the decision. Talent management has been a business obsession at least since 1997, when the consultancy McKinsey identified a “war for talent”. The most visible battleground of this “war” is team sport. Football, in particular, is “the quintessential model for modern-day talent-dependent business”, writes Chris Brady, professor at Salford Business School. Big football clubs pay more than half their revenues to between 3 and 7 per cent of their workforce: the players. These young men are rich, multinational, mobile, often equipped with large egos and therefore hard to manage. Football managers are, above all, talent managers.',

    topic: 'cooking',
    author: 'weegembump',
    body: "This comforting soup is a delightful blend of roasted sweet potato and butternut squash, given a subtle sweetness from a drizzle of honey before baking. Once golden and tender, the vegetables are blended into a velvety smooth mixture with warming spices that bring out their natural richness. It’s a perfect dish for autumn or winter, offering both nourishment and flavour in every spoonful.\n\nTo accompany the soup, serve with toasted ciabatta slices brushed generously with garlic and fresh lemon zest. The zesty, savoury crunch contrasts beautifully with the creamy texture of the soup, creating a balanced and satisfying meal. Whether you're hosting friends or simply craving something hearty, this dish is sure to please.",

    body: 'The discovery of a million-year-old campfire in a South African cave has given archaeologists remarkable insight into how early humans lived and ate. Among the charred remains were traces of animal bones and plant ash, suggesting that our ancestors – likely Homo erectus – had already begun experimenting with fire to prepare food. This ancient meal marks one of the earliest known instances of cooking and highlights a pivotal moment in human evolution.\n\nThe act of cooking did more than just make food easier to chew and digest; it fundamentally changed our species. By unlocking more nutrients, cooked food allowed early humans to support larger brains, develop social structures, and spend less time chewing raw meat or foraging. Cooking helped shape not only our biology but also our culture, laying the foundation for the culinary traditions and communal eating rituals we practise today.',

    author: 'grumpy19',
    body: "Thanksgiving is more than just a celebration of food; it is an opportunity to gather with loved ones and enjoy the full experience of a thoughtfully planned meal. While much attention is given to the turkey, stuffing and all the traditional sides, drinks are often overlooked. A well-chosen selection of cocktails, mocktails, or even a spiced punch can elevate the occasion and offer something special for each guest. The right drink can complement the meal, enhance the flavours on the plate, and bring an extra touch of seasonal warmth to the table.\n\nWhether you're planning a classic menu or something more adventurous, consider pairing your dishes with drinks that reflect the autumnal spirit. Think crisp apple cider with a cinnamon twist, cranberry spritzers with a splash of soda water, or a smooth bourbon cocktail with hints of maple. For non-drinkers or younger guests, infusions of herbal tea or mulled juices can be just as festive. Whatever you serve, ensure the drinks feel as intentional as the food — they are, after all, part of the celebration.",

    title: 'High Altitude Cooking',
    topic: 'cooking',
    author: 'happyamy2016',
    body: 'Cooking at high altitudes presents unique challenges that many outdoor enthusiasts fail to anticipate. As elevation increases, the boiling point of water drops, which means food takes longer to cook and recipes requiring precise temperatures may not turn out as expected. For example, boiling an egg or cooking pasta above 10,000 feet can take significantly more time than at sea level.\n\nTo adapt, backpackers and campers need to adjust both their cooking methods and expectations. Using pressure cookers, increasing cooking times, and selecting foods that rehydrate easily can all help ensure success. Understanding the effects of altitude on heat and moisture is essential for anyone planning to prepare meals in mountainous terrain.',

Imagine a world where presenting a platter of seasonal vegetables inspires the same amount of cooing that the turkey does. Welcome to the world of twice-baked butternut squash. Sure, you could just roast some squash wedges and call it a day. But where's the fun in that? To make this year's most impressive vegetable side, Epi's food director Rhoda Boone gave super-seasonal butternut squash the twice-baked potatoes treatment: Mash the inside of the vegetable with butter, cream, and anything else that might make it more delicious, then pile it back into the vegetable, bake it until golden and velvety. The result is a jaw-dropping, brightly colored sweet-meet-savory butternut squash side dish. Here are just a few more reasons this creation belongs on this year's Thanksgiving table:",

If you get something to eat, great, but the most important thing is to be outside where the stories are. There’s nothing happening at your desk but a screen. Anyway! I’m thinking chicken paprikash for dinner tonight, a nod toward the coming fall, served over buttery egg noodles, with green beans on the side. If you have the time, make an apple cake for dessert.',

So popular are kebabs cooked by Muslim Uighurs on the streets of Beijing that the city banned outdoor grills in 2014 in order to reduce smoke, which officials said was exacerbating the capital’s notorious smog (the air today is hardly less noxious). Often such food is claimed to be qing zhen, meaning 'pure and true', or halal, prepared according to traditional Islamic regulations. But who can tell? Last year angry Muslims besieged a halal bakery in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province, after pork sausages were found in the shop’s delivery van. There have been several scandals in recent years involving rat meat or pork being sold as lamb. These have spread Muslim mistrust of domestically produced halal products.",

Reviewing over 200 studies in 55 countries, the report finds that one in five fish sold has been mislabelled. Although fish fraud is common early in the supply chain, most of it comes at the retail level. In 65% of cases, the motivation is economic—slippery restaurateurs frequently serve up cheaper fish than they advertise to cut costs. In America, Oceana has reported instances of tilapia being sold as the more expensive red snapper. Especially brazen fish criminals have invented new types of fish entirely. In Brazil, researchers were puzzled to find markets selling 'douradinha', ' non-existent species. Close inspection found that 60% of such fish were actually 'vulture' catfish, a relatively undesirable dish. Reports in America of catfish being substituted for more expensive fish date back to at least 2002; Oceana’s study suggests that the phenomenon is spreading.",

Often blamed for health issues without scientific backing, MSG was unfairly linked to so-called 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome'—a myth now widely debunked. Today, MSG is celebrated for its ability to unlock deep umami flavor, enriching everything from broths to snacks. As culinary professionals rediscover its potential, MSG is being recognised not as a harmful additive, but as a powerful tool that enhances the natural taste of food. Its journey from infamy to fame is a testament to how science and open-minded cooking can change perspectives.",

Breakfast consisted of fried eggs and sausage, and to the children’s delight, they could have seconds—as long as they didn’t reach for bread, cereal, or toast. This flipped our usual food routine on its head, and instead of protest, there was excitement. It felt oddly festive, like celebrating a holiday out of season.\n\nThe idea behind the Paleolithic diet is to mimic the eating habits of our hunter-gatherer ancestors by focusing on whole foods such as meats, vegetables, fruits, and nuts, while avoiding processed items and grains. That morning marked not only a dietary shift but also a fresh perspective on what constitutes a ‘normal’ meal. It reminded us that sometimes, simplicity and novelty in food can spark curiosity and conversation around the table.',

This was the world’s first proper portion of cultured meat, a beef burger created by Mark Post, professor of physiology, and his team at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Post (which rhymes with ‘lost’, not ‘ghost’) has been working on in vitro meat (IVM) since 2009. On 5 August this year he presented his cultured beef burger to the world as a ‘proof of concept’. Having shown that the technology works, Post believes that in a decade or so we could see commercial production of meat that has been grown in a lab rather than reared and slaughtered. The comforting illusion that supermarket trays of plastic-wrapped steaks are not pieces of dead animal might become a discomforting reality.',

    body: `In the realm of football's grand design,
    There stands a man both wise and kind,
    With vision bold and strategies bright,
    Eric ten Hag, a beacon of light.
    
    From Haaksbergen he did arise,
    A coach with fire in his eyes,
    His playing days were but a prelude,
    To a managerial path pursued.
    
    With Twente's youth, he honed his craft,
    Unveiling talents, making them laugh,
    He saw the spark in every soul,
    And nurtured them to reach their goal.
    
    Then came the call from Ajax's door,
    A chance to reshape and to restore,
    A sleeping giant poised to rise,
    Under ten Hag's enlightened guise.
    
    His philosophy, a work of art,
    Possession, movement, playing smart,
    A symphony of passes danced,
    As Ajax's prowess was enhanced.
    
    The pitch became his chessboard vast,
    Each player moving, shadows cast,
    With precision and calculated might,
    Ten Hag orchestrated their footballing flight.
    
    From the back they built their dream,
    With pressing high, they'd make teams scream,
    Fluid movement, a joyful ballet,
    As Ajax's brilliance came to play.
    
    Champions they rose in Dutch terrain,
    Their dominance, a joyous reign,
    The Eredivisie their rightful throne,
    Eric ten Hag, a leader known.
    
    But it was Europe where he'd truly shine,
    Challenging giants, weaving a line,
    With courage and belief, they'd soar,
    In the Champions League, they'd explore.
    
    A fearless march against the odds,
    The footballing world in awe applauds,
    With ten Hag's guidance, they'd dare to roam,
    The young and talented, finding home.
    
    In battles fierce, they etched their name,
    Defying history, fortune's game,
    A testament to ten Hag's command,
    That Ajax's spirit forever will stand.
    
    So let us sing a song of praise,
    For Eric ten Hag's guiding ways,
    A mastermind, a football sage,
    Whose brilliance sets the pitch ablaze.`,
